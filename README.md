# Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods Assignment

This repository contains implementations of various decision tree and ensemble learning algorithms from scratch in Python, along with demonstrations in Google Colab notebooks. Additionally, we showcase the usage of popular libraries such as XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest, AdaBoost, and DecisionTree classifiers, regressors, and ranking techniques.
